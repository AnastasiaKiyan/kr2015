"If you're tired of London, you are tired of living" - that became the catch phrase says it all, or almost all about this unique city.
After the great fire (Great Fire of London) 1666 London frustrated very active, but rather haphazardly. During
 time, the city absorbed the bordering villages, many of which are today preserved their way of life and characteristics.
 Each has its own main street - "High Street" - with local shops and restaurants, its own central square with
Church and City Hall. Residents of London "villages", for the most part, go to work in the city center, but free
 prefer to spend time at the "self." The best tenderloin buy from "his" butcher, fresh vegetables and fruits at a local
 shop, hang out with friends and drink a pint of beer to go "their" pub meal and spend time with his family - in
"his" restaurant.

As with any capital city, London has something without which it is impossible to imagine: Tower Bridge (Tower Bridge), Big Ben and Houses
 Parliament (Big Ben and Parliament Houses), red double-decker buses (Double Decker), friendly British police Bobi
(Bobby). Those who come here not for the first time, I am glad to see the characters of this historic city as his old friends,
 It has not changed during the separation.

The lush 70 - 80 years there was a great variety of buildings rather neprityagatelnogo species - usually celebrated Commerce
victory over good taste. However, increased skyscrapers City and Canary Wharf, the financial center of modern London,
radically transform its present face.
However, the attractive force of London, in our opinion, is not the grandeur of its buildings, not in the glare of its boulevards
or sensationalism of contemporary architecture, but in the colorful community of people from different countries and continents, practicing different
religions and speaking different languages ??- the community, which includes, of course, "authentic" Londoners, and true British tradition
and values. Taxi drivers - Cockney still allow myself to call his passenger "Darling", "Love" or "Governor", is still
wandering through the narrow streets of the modern city, you can stumble upon the church buildings and stables, reminiscent of the Middle Ages, buildings
 Parliament is still open to anyone wishing to attend the debates in the royal parks can also listen to all
 concerts of military bands, and the Royal Albert Hall (Albert Hall) - classical music. And the English Cup Of Tea
 (Cup of Tea - a cup of tea), still warms the soul in any weather and at any troubles.
