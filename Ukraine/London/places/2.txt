2. Big Ben and Downing Street
      Have you ever seen Big Ben on the TV screen? Sam just to see him live! A huge clock tower can be seen from a mile away, she
      just give you the feeling that you have come to London. Walk near the tower, then cross the Westminster Abbey to
      Whitehall, and then find yourself in Downing Street. Although you can not enter the official residence of the Prime Minister, but
      definitely see him through the bars. Well, if you're lucky enough to get there by 4 o'clock in the afternoon, you can even see the dismantling of the ceremony.
