1.Meeting  with Paris is best to start from the center and walk along the Champs Elysees, Boulevard,
   which originates from the Arc de Triomphe and leads to Place de la Concorde. It should be noted that this is the longest street
   Paris. The street is still the most famous and most expensive - shops, banks, luxury restaurants, cafes and great
   the number of first-class hotels. On Christmas and New Year the whole street just buried in the lights and presents a fantastic spectacle.
