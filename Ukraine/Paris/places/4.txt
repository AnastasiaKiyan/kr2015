4. Not more than a very interesting and will visit Europe's largest theme park - Disneyland Paris.
   The park is divided into five thematic areas. Literally everything here talks about some fantastic characters. All attractions in
   Disneyland even simply indispensable. And you can ride on the most liked, but to make a choice in anyone's favor
   it is very difficult, almost unbearable.
