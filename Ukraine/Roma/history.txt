The Eternal City, where all roads lead where you can live life for one long vacation day or lose a few
weeks. The concentration of attractions in Rome reaches values ??such that only a couple of hours in the heart of the city
and the brain begin to abandon the poor tourist to accommodate new ones. Therefore, to be held in Rome a day or two - just a crime. This could
come and come and come. The main thing - to realize that Rome - this is not Italy. Think of it as a separate
State or even a separate peace. Rome monstrously old and forever young, he has seen the rise and fall of one of the greatest
civilizations of the world. It is no wonder that the entire historic center declared a World Heritage Site.

One of the most visited cities in the world, Rome, in his classic, "old" appearance may seem to someone not even
too attractive. Most monotonous sand-colored ruins, which are encountered everywhere in the center, only bump
guests that stems street vociferous crowd and constantly walk into the frame. But beyond all this madness, for
New boundaries of the center, the Vatican, the Old Rome, the Northern Center and the Coliseum area, interested travelers
still waiting for the hidden treasure.
