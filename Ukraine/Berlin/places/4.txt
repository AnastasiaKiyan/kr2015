Reichstag - another building that is sure to visit in Berlin. It is really nice, even though the photographs may not seem so. Hitler ordered to burn it in 1933, destroying everything inside and seriously damaging the dome. Accused of setting fire to the Communists, and this fact served as pretext for the Nazis to eliminate the Communists as the political opponents. During the division of Germany's state of the building has deteriorated significantly due to the destruction of the dome. After the reunification of the government has decided to return to Berlin and the Reichstag was restored again as a parliament. Instead of the old dome was built another glass, which offers excellent views of Berlin. It should be up there, plus it's free.
