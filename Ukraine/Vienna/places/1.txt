1. Schonbrunn Palace
Schonbrunn Palace is perhaps the most famous and most visited tourist attraction in Vienna. Looking at pictures is difficult to imagine the huge size of the palace, today it is more than 1440 different rooms and premises. The main phase of construction of the residence in its present form was completed in 1712. The main model for the architects was the magnificent Versailles. The interiors of the palace, richly decorated with gold ornaments, even more impressive than the appearance of the royal castle. Imperial Gardens with fountains, statues and labyrinths, terraces and promenades create amazing beauty of the landscape.
