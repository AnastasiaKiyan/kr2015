4. The Vienna City Hall
A huge town hall, which now meets the City of Vienna, will enchant you with its incredible Gothic Revival style. The main facade is decorated with numerous arcades and columns. Above the building is dominated by four high towers. Between them stands in the heart of a huge 105-meter clock tower topped by an iron sculpture guards the town hall. Be sure to take a few pictures at night (especially in the winter months), when the building is highlighted with floodlights. Directly in front of the town hall is a small picturesque park where you can walk along the wonderful alleys.
